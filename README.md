# Project for Garage48 Student Startup Camp 2018

Well, our great initial idea didn't work out because of bureaucracy, so now this is just something that barely resembles Twitter. Except it doesn't have remote persistence. Also it leaks memory quite severely. It skips frames when scrolling. It sucks at taking photos. When scrolling vote handlers are attached several times, but it doesn't really matter since the votes aren't sent anywhere.

You could say that it's not a very good mobile app overall, but if you want somehow found this code and for some strange reason want to use it anywhere I'll attach a licence to avoid any legal confusion.
